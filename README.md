# Networking Laboratory Slides

These are the slides I've made with prof. [Claudio Ardagna](http://homes.di.unimi.it/ardagna) for the Networking laboratory class, which I've been supporting during this academic year at University of Milan.
The main tool we've used during the lab has been [IMUNES](http://imunes.net/), an open-source network topology simulator built on top of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org/).

Using this software we've been able to explore characteristics and implement functionalities of the whole network stack.

Slides are in italian language and cover only a part of the whole course.
They are open and free to use, but please if you use them as provided, keep the credits :)
If you need the PPTs, contact me via [mail](https://patrizio.tufarolo.eu/#contacts).

Enjoy them!
